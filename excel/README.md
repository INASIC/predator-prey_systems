# Excel Spreadsheet

This folder contains an excel spreadsheet, illustrating the Lotka-Volterra model for predator-prey systems. 

It is recommended to look at my Jupyter Notebook instead, as I have devoted more time to that one than here. The excel spreadsheet was for me to just to become familiar with the Euler method of integration.
