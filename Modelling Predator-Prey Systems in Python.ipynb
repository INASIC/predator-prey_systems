    "We will do this by first building a deterministic, idealized model for the predator-prey systems. Towards the end of the notebook, we will then introduce __stochastics__ into the equations - so that the model more accurately captures the noise found in real world scenarios. \n",

    "In introducing stochasticity to our models, there are numerous ways we can model __randomness__. In this notebook, we will first introduce the simple __Brownian motion__ to our models, and then we will compare this to the white noise randomness generated by the __Weiner__ equation, and then finally we will look at the coloured noise generated by the __Levy__ equations."
